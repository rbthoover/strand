# strand 0.2.0 (unreleased)

* The `PortOpt` class has been exported. This class can be used to solve single
portfolio optimization problems.

* Writing html reports for a simulation based on an Rmd template is now possible
using the `writeReport` method of the `Simulation` class.

* Average volume has been changed to a market value measure from a shares
measure. This makes it much easier to provide a measure of ADV (average daily
volume) for setting trading and position limit constraints.

* Added input_dates parameter to Simulation class constructor. The date vector
passed to input_dates contols the dates on which input data (e.g., alpha and
risk factors) is updated.

* Added force-trim feature to trim back positions that grow too large. Setting
the simulator configuration parameter `force_trim_factor` to a numeric value X
will cause orders to be created that trim positions back to X times their
maximum allowable size.

* Added force-exit feature for non-investable securities. Setting the simulator
configuration parameter `force_exit_non_investable` to `TRUE` will cause exit
orders to be created for positions not in the universe during a simulation.

* Now saving gross, long, and short exposures in addition to net.

* Standardized simulation result data and plotting methods to have a
strategy_name parameter where appropriate.

* Added new plotting methods for the `Simulation` class: `plotContribution`,
`plotTurnover`, `plotUniverseSize`, and `plotNonInvestablePct`.

* Added `overallReturnsByMonthDf` method for the `Simulation` class.

* Fixed recording of loosened constraints during simulation.

* Fixed loading of configuration information in `readFeather`.

# strand 0.1.3 (2020-05-24)

* The example in the package vignette now uses the sample datasets included in
the package.

* `overallStatsDf()` includes a max drawdown entry.

# strand 0.1.2 (2020-05-22)

* `Rsymphony` dependency has been moved from Imports to Suggests to make
installation easier.

* Example shiny application now uses the sample datasets provided with the package,
and can now be run directly by calling the new function `example_shiny_app()`.

* New function `example_strategy_config()` provides an easy way to grab the
sample configuration used in examples and the shiny app.

# strand 0.1.1 (2020-05-18)

* Initial version on CRAN
